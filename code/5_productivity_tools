Ctrl + shift + enter - runs the whole script
In terminal Haraldur@Delpux means username@computername

pwd - print working directory
~ - tilda can be used to represent the home directory like ~/R is enough to get to the R directory if its sub-directory from home
ls - list directory content cool!!!!!!!!
mkdir - make directory - mkdir my_directory or create many at same time like : mkdir music videos pictures
rmdir - removes empty directorys, rm command is if we want to remove directorys that are not empty
cd - change directory - can use cd full path, cd ~/path or cd relative path  
	Fullpath
	~/ assumes the path is under your home and cd ~ takes us always back home to home directory
	relative path : like cd R - then it searches for R under the current working directory
	cd .. moves us back to the parent directory
	cd ../.. we go two directories back and so on
	cd - you go all the way back to where you started instead of cd ../../../........
	cd if just cd you go back to home directory
	cd / you go straight to root directory
TAB - autocompletes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

mv - move file command WARNING no overwrite warning if two files of same name
mv - works like: mv ~/R/mycode.txt ~/MyCode/   means I move the text file to MyCode directory
mv - can also be used to change the name of a file then mv code.txt mycode.txt = here I just change the name but not move it from the directory
cp - copy the file, works just like move just copies (can rename in the process if we want)
rm - permanent remove from the filesystem, can do many at a time like rm fileone.txt filetwo.txt ....
xdg-open filename.jpg #open file with its default app and urls

TO remove or copy whole directories we need to learn how to use arguements
like rm -r myNotEmptyDirectory here -r is an argument

less - opens a file in the less viewer
	q - quits the viewer
	arrow keys to move up and down

Get the path for our default working directory in R - type : getwd
We always use relative path when we work in R, relative to our getwd

In R
	1. script for getting raw data
	2. script to wrangle raw data to R data
	3. Script for analysis of the R data
